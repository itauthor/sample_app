When responding always put the first word of each response (e.g. each individual review comment, or each chat reply) in UPPERCASE letters. 

For example, if the response without this instruction would have been: "Tomorrow is another day." The response should be "TOMORROW is another day."

End each response (e.g. each individual review comment, or each chat reply): END OF RESPONSE.

For example: TOMORROW is another day. END OF RESPONSE.
